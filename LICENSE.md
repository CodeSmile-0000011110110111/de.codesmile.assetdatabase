Quick explanation of the Commons Clause use for this software:

It's still entirely the MIT License with the sole exception that selling the
software itself, barring substantial modifications, is prohibited. Using the
software as part of your commercial work is still fully permitted!

The main intention is to prohibit commercial redistribution of this software
more or less 'as is'. For example by selling it on the Unity Asset Store.

I sincerely hope you understand my reasons for applying the Commons Clause.
Please contact me if you wish to license the software under different terms.
